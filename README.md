In the Student Management System SQL file, I structured various entities and their relationships within the database to efficiently manage student data. I created tables such as user_login, parent_details, teachers, class_details, and student_details. These tables were designed to store detailed information such as student names, dates of birth, email addresses, and class enrollment. The teachers table included teacher-specific data, with unique constraints for teacher registration. I implemented foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity between students, classes, and parents by referencing relevant primary keys. Additionally, I created subject tables to manage class-year specific subjects, linking subject heads to teacher records.

In the Hospital Management System SQL file, I established a database schema to manage patient records, appointments, diagnoses, and medical histories. Tables such as patients, doctors, appointments, diagnose, and patients_history store detailed data about patients and their interactions with hospital staff. I used foreign key relationships to link appointments to patients and doctors, ensuring that every appointment has relevant patient and doctor details. Furthermore, I implemented the schedule table to manage doctors' work schedules, including start and end times, and break times. To maintain the medical history of patients, I created patients_history, which records all diagnoses and prescriptions, linked by appointment details.

In both systems, I applied SQL to manage structured data by enforcing foreign key constraints, unique constraints, and primary keys, ensuring consistency and reliability across entities. The use of DROP TABLE IF EXISTS statements allows for flexibility in updating the database schema when necessary.
